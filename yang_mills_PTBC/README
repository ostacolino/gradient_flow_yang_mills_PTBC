** ACTION
*****************************************************
The action used is the standard Wilson action, which for the SU(N) group can be
written as the sum of

-beta*(1/N)Re(Tr(paquette))

and possibly a theta therm. If --enable-imaginary-theta is used during
configuration an imaginary theta term is used of the form

-theta_im*Top_charge

where the simplest discretization with definite parity of the topological
charge is used (see later "A note on the topological charge" for more details).

In yang_mills_tracedef a trace deformation is also added to the action, of the
form

sum_{i=0}^{N/2} h_i|Tr(polyakov^{i+1})/N|^2

The update is performed by means of heatbath and overrelaxation updates (and in
some case also Metropolis updates) implemented a la Cabibbo-Marinari.


** OTHER CONFIGURE PARAMETERS
*****************************************************

The choice of the gauge group happens at configuration time through the macro
N_c (N_c=1, 2, ... are available, with N_c=1 corresponding to the U(1) gauge
theory). As an example, to simulate the SU(5) gauge theory the program has to
be configured using

./configure N_c=5

Space-time dimension is fixed by the configure macro ST_dim (ST_dim>1) and the
number of levels to be used in the multilevel algorithm is fixed by Num_levels.
Finally the configure option 

--enable-use-openmp

enable OpenMP use, the number of threads to be used is fixed by the configure
macro Num_threads. 

After the configuration, the compilation is performed as usual by
make

Defining the macro DEBUG several sanity checks are activated, while the macros
OPT_MULTIHIT and OPT_MULTILEVEL can be used to optimize the number of multihit
steps and the number of updates to be used in the multilevel algorithm.


** INPUT FILE AND SOME CONVENTIONS
*****************************************************

A template input file is created when calling executables without input file
and everything following # (up to carriage return) in the input file is
interpreted as a comment.

Some conventions used in the code are the following:

time is direction 0 and the numbers follosing "size" in the imput are in the
order "time space1 space2 ..."

when computing Polyakov loop correlators, Polyakov loops are separated along
direction 1 and, when computing flux tube profiles, the transverse direction is
direction 2 

level 0 of the multilevel is the one corresponding to the largest
timeslice.


** A NOTE ON THE TOPOLOGICAL CHARGE
*********************************************************

Topology for the general group: in the continuum the topological charge is
defined in 4 space-time dimensions by

Q=\frac{1}{64 \pi^2} \int \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} 
   F_{\mu\nu}^a F_{\rho\sigma}^a d^x

with the normalization Tr(T_iT_j)=K \delta_{ij} such that the longest root of
the representation is normalized to 1.
[see C. W. Bernard, N. H. Christ, A. H. Guth, E. J. Weinberg 
 Phys. Rev. D 16, 2967 (1977) ]

For SU(N) this base is that of the generalized Gell-Mann matrices divided by
two and in this representation Tr(T^aT^b)=(1/2)\delta^{ab}, so that 

F_{\mu\nu}^aF_{\rho\sigma}^a=2Tr(F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma})

and thus 

Q=\frac{1}{32 \pi^2} \int \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} 
Tr(F_{\mu\nu} F_{\rho\sigma}) d^x

The discretization used on the lattice is obtained by using the clover form of
the discretized field-strenth, i.e. the clover Q_{\mu\nu} is given by

Q_{\mu\nu}  ~ 4 + 4 i a^2 F_{\mu\nu}

and thus

F_{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{8i}( Q_{\mu\nu} - Q_{\mu\nu}^{dag} )  

By using this expression we get

Tr(F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma}) = 
          =-\frac{1}{2^5} ReTr(Q_{\mu\nu}[Q_{\rho\sigma}-Q_{\rho\sigma}^{dag}])

We now note that of the 24 terms
\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma} only 3 are independent:

2: single exchange on the first term   F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma} ->
                                               F_{\nu\mu}F_{\rho\sigma}
2: single exchange on the second term  F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma} -> 
                                               F_{\mu\nu}F_{\sigma\rho}
2: exchage                             F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma} -> 
                                               F_{\rho\sigma}F_{\mu\nu} 
3: remaining permutations of indices: e.g 0123, 0213, 0312

thus 

\frac{1}{32} \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}Tr(F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma})=

 =-\frac{1}{32} * \frac{1}{2^5} * 2^3 * [ sum on independent permutations
              of \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} 
              ReTr(Q_{\mu\nu}[Q_{\rho\sigma}-Q_{\rho\sigma}^{dag}]) ]
  
 =-\frac{1}{128} [ sum on independent permutations
              of \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} 
              ReTr(Q_{\mu\nu}[Q_{\rho\sigma}-Q_{\rho\sigma}^{dag}]) ]

This is the expression used in the code.
